# Hotel Booking Status Predicton


Objective : To predict weather a customer is going to cancle the booking or not.

Part 1 : It consist of initial data loading, checking usability. Doing EDA and finding out booking trends. The end part involves understanding for customer behavior through data visualization.

Part 2 : This involves the data transformation and making it ready for modeling. Various models like Xg-Boost and Cat-Boost are fit and evalueted.

DATASET DETAILS: This dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children and/or babies and the number of available parking spaces.

Future Scope : In this project only model fititng and comparison was done. Further selecting the best model and doing hyper-parameter tunning would lead to a good solution for the hotels to predict if the booking is getting cancled. This can be converted to a beautiful app for hotels. I will keep updating this space so stay tunned to see how the application turns out to be.
